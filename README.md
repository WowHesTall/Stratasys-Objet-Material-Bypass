SOMB - Stratasys Objet Material Bypass
-----------

This is software to allow the use of expired & non-supported PolyJet materials on Objet (any maybe other Stratasys) 3D printers.

You may use this code to emulate supported material types whilst using unsupported cartridges. e.g. SUP706 on an Objet30 V2.
