Easter Eggs
-----------

The following is a collection of information I have gleaned over the years working along side our Stratasys Objet30 V2.

## Maintenance Mode
### Access
To access maintenance mode, move to cursor to the bottom right hand corner of the screen and press `CTRL` + `M`. A warning shall appear - press `OK`. Failure to move the cursor will not present the mode on the toolbar.

### Features
The maintenance menu gives you unrestricted access to the printer settings and much more! Useful tools include Calibration, Weight Test modes, Incoming Slice viewer and of course, Parameter Manager. Paramater Manager allows the fine tuning of every critical printer setting, from print head temperature, to RFID COM port selection.

## Materials
### Pick-N-Mix
All Objet materials cure using the same basic set of parameters; VeroClear and MED610 being the exception. The same UV bulb pass and print head voltages are used accross the board. Chopping and changing materials by way of swapping material cartridge RFID tags is the most simple way of trying more exotic materials your HASP licence might try to keep from you. I recommend taking a Sharpie to the tag, else you'll soon forget which tag is for which container. The key difference for VeroClear and MED610 is the layer hight of just 16 microns - all other materials are 32. This change in layer hight requres a special set of lower head voltages.

### Recycle
Waste material is anything but! Model and support materials soon settle out in the waste cartridge. A decent syringe will allow you to save pennies and recycle spent material.
